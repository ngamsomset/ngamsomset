### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ My name is Brian, and below is a short description about me.

## My background
I have a background in an aircraft engineering, particularly - aircraft maintenance. I worked as a certified aircraft mechanic for two years before I switched my career to software developer.
Engineering has been my domain since I was young where I love to disassemble things to see how it works. Obviously, sometime you can't actually put it back together. But that's part of the learning process.
One thing in common between aircraft engineering and software engineering is they required logical thinking throughout. You need to know exactly what is going on before you made a decision. 
This required a solid understanding of an underlying logic of the system that you are working on. But one thing that I think make software engineering stand out is that it's mallauble. Regardless of ideas that's
on your mind, you can turn it into reality. This is the part where I think software make me fell in love with it. 

## Education
I have a Master's degree in computers science with a major in software engineering and machine learning. If you are curious why I did two majors? And my answer is very simple, curiosity. Before I start my master's degree
I know that software engineering is what I wanted but at the time, machine learning skyrocketed with the introduction of ChatGPT. I want to know that is that all about so I thought to myself that I should dig deep into the topic.
My software engineering major focus on microservices, software testing and design patterns. They guided you through how things work not how to use it. This might sound contrast of what it suppose to be but in reality, knowing
how something works systematically and conceptually helps me understand when I need to implement them. Another key lesson that I learned is how important is the planning part. There are countless component that needed to 
take into consideration in building a piece of software. All of them are connected to each other in some way. For instance, why microservices works the way they are? How to think as a service oriented computing in the first place?
How important is software testing? And what will happen if you don't implement them? I love one quote from one of my professor when I asked him about software testing, I asked "If I build a small application, do all testing neccesary?" 
he replied "testing is mandatory for every piece of software, not optional." and throughout the subject, he demonstrated how important for software to have a testing implemented before we even start to write an actual code.

On the other hand, machine learning subject teach me many things from the mathametical concept behind them and the implementation of the program in specific area. The interesting part is what make a good machine learning model?
This is the question that needed to be answer along the way while I was in the journey. However, the answer is not that straight forward and required a lots of particular domain knowledge. In some topic, machine learning
model still be a black box and required further research. The good part about machine learning is that there are many area that need to be explore. Some of the area of machine learning that proven to be working benefit our
daily life, some such as computer vision. One of the area of machine learning utilized camera to detect and analyze object from street sign detection, speed camera and object recognition. Machine learning allow me to 
expose to various tools and framework that use in the market such as Pythorch and Scikit-learn.
